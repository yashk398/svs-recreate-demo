This is a demo project made by Yash Sandeep Kadam during CapGemini training.

THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO RECREATE A WEBSITE THAT ALREADY EXISTS FOR TRAINING ASSIGNMENT ONLY.

NOT MEANT TO BE DISTRIBUTED OR USED COMMERCIALLY. 


URL OF ORIGINAL WEBSITE(http://svsindia.org.in/)

Major Changes To Original Website : 
1. No Right Click on images (most)
2. No marqueue, instead a small alert bar exists(dismissable).
3. Modals used for image-gallery are optimized to show any clicked image using one modal template.
4. This development uses Bootstrap majorly
5. Contacts and mails open up supported apps and location/address uses GMAPS iFrames. 


Most data/development is raw and not hosting ready as of first commit.

Images and icons used are Royalty Free Assets.

No contacts should be misused, as this is a replica of an NGO Website.
